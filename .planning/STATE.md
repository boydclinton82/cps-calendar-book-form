## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Blueprint spec depth — AI consumer won't be overwhelmed; exhaustive detail required
- Live + code approach — screenshots capture visual truth; code reveals logic
- Technology-neutral behavior specs — Rails is different from React; behavior transfers
- Single version only — no dual/eureka patterns in spec

### Pending Todos

None.
