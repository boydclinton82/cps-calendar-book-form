# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Another Claude Code instance can perfectly recreate the single booking form from this spec alone
**Current focus:** Phase 5 - Visual Capture (starting v2.0 Booking Spec Package)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 10 (Visual Capture)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-13 — v2.0 roadmap created, ready to begin visual capture phase

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 40% (v1.0 complete: 4/10 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **Blueprint spec depth** — AI consumer requires exhaustive detail for "perfect" recreation
- **Live + code approach** — Screenshots capture visual truth; code reveals logic screenshots can't
- **Technology-neutral behavior specs** — Rails differs from React; behavior transfers, patterns don't
- **Single version only** — No dual/eureka patterns in spec

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
