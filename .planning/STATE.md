## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Phase | Impact |
|----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Blueprint spec depth | AI consumer requires exhaustive detail for "perfect" recreation | 05-roadmap | All spec phases |
| Live + code approach | Screenshots capture visual truth; code reveals logic screenshots can't | 05-roadmap | Phase 05-07 |
| Technology-neutral behavior specs | Rails differs from React; behavior transfers, patterns don't | 05-roadmap | Phase 06-08 |
| Single version only | No dual/eureka patterns in spec | 05-roadmap | All spec phases |
| Playwright for automation | Better selector stability and modern browser API vs Puppeteer | 05-01 | Screenshot capture |
| Three breakpoints (375/768/1440) | Cover mobile, tablet, desktop for responsive behavior | 05-01 | Screenshot coverage |
| Category-based screenshot organization | Map screenshots directly to VCAP requirements for traceability | 05-01 | Phase 05-07 |
