# CSS Files - Visual Reference Only

The CSS files in this extraction are included for visual reference.
The Rails implementation will use its own styling approach (likely Tailwind or Rails asset pipeline).

These files document:
- Color values and theme (dark theme with cyan/orange accents)
- Spacing and layout patterns
- Responsive breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1440px)
- Animation/transition definitions

Do NOT port CSS syntax. Use these as a visual specification alongside the annotated screenshots from Phase 5.
