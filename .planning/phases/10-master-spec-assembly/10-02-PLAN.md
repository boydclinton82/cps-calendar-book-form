<objective>
Human verification that the complete specification package is ready for Rails Claude consumption.

Purpose: This is the final quality gate before declaring v2.0 complete. A human reviews the assembled spec package to confirm it is accurate, complete, and navigable. This catches issues that automated checks cannot: Does the reading order make sense? Are the build instructions realistic? Would Rails Claude actually succeed with this package?

Output: Confirmed or corrected specification package.

  <what-built>
Complete specification package for Rails Claude consumption:

1. **SPEC.md** -- Master entry point with:
   - Numbered reading order (7 steps)
   - Directory navigation map (all Phase 5-9 deliverable files)
   - Cross-reference table (what to read for each task type)
   - Milestone-based build instructions (8 milestones)
   - Three-tier boundary system (Always / Ask / Never)
   - Technology stack requirements
   - Success criteria checklist
   - Conflict resolution rules

2. **SYSTEM-SUMMARY.md** -- Technology-neutral overview with:
   - All feature behaviors (booking, editing, deletion, conflicts, multi-hour, Book Now, timezone, sync)
   - Data model (technology-neutral)
   - User experience flows
   - Interaction modes (NAVIGATION, PANEL, POPUP)
   - Edge case categories (41 scenarios referenced)
   - Technology constraints (must preserve vs can adapt)

3. **Phase 5-9 deliverables** -- 20+ detailed spec documents already created:
   - 40 screenshots (20 raw + 20 annotated)
   - Clean reference code with annotations
   - UI/UX specs (layout, tokens, states, keyboard, responsive, animations)
   - Architecture specs (storage, config, API, polling, state)
   - Functional specs (booking flow, Book Now, timezone, time handling, edge cases)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Quick verification (5 minutes):**

1. Open `.planning/phases/10-master-spec-assembly/SPEC.md`
   - Read the "How to Use This Spec" section. Does the reading order make sense?
   - Scan the directory navigation map. Are all documents listed?
   - Review Build Instructions. Are the milestones in a logical order?
   - Check Boundaries. Are the Always/Ask/Never tiers reasonable?

2. Open `.planning/phases/10-master-spec-assembly/SYSTEM-SUMMARY.md`
   - Does it accurately describe the booking system you built?
   - Are there any features missing from the summary?
   - Is the language technology-neutral (no React terms)?

3. Mental test: If you handed this package to a new Claude Code instance working on a blank Rails project, would it have everything it needs?

**Things to look for:**
- Missing features or behaviors
- Incorrect descriptions of how the system works
- Missing documents from the directory map
- Build instruction order that would cause problems
- Boundaries that are too strict or too permissive
