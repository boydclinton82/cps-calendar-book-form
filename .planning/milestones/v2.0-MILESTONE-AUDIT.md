## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker result:** PASSED

### Wiring Summary

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Phase 10 → All phases (SPEC.md entry point) | Connected |
| Phase 9 → Phase 8 (functional → architecture) | Connected |
| Phase 9 → Phase 6 (functional → code reference) | Connected |
| Phase 7 → Phase 5 (UI → screenshots) | Connected |
| Phase 7 → Phase 6 (UI → CSS code) | Connected |
| Phase 8 → Phase 6 (architecture → code) | Connected |

- **Deliverables wired:** 19/19
- **Orphaned documents:** 0
- **Missing connections:** 0
- **Broken cross-references:** 0

### Data Consistency

Booking object schema verified identical across phases:
- Phase 6 (code): `{ "YYYY-MM-DD": { "HH:00": { user, duration } } }`
- Phase 8 (architecture): Same structure in DATA-STORAGE.md
- Phase 9 (functional): Same structure in BOOKING-FLOW.md

Operating hours, field names, interaction modes, and validation rules all consistent across documents.

## E2E Consumer Flows

3 flows traced end-to-end through specification documents — all complete.

| Flow | Steps | Documents Touched | Status |
|------|-------|-------------------|--------|
| Booking creation | 7 steps | BOOKING-FLOW, LAYOUT-STRUCTURE, API-CONTRACTS, DATA-STORAGE, STATE-MANAGEMENT, POLLING-SYNC | Complete |
| Booking editing | 5 steps | BOOKING-FLOW, COMPONENT-STATES, API-CONTRACTS, STATE-MANAGEMENT | Complete |
| Booking deletion | 4 steps | BOOKING-FLOW, API-CONTRACTS, DATA-STORAGE, STATE-MANAGEMENT | Complete |

### Consumer Readiness

| Area | Can Rails Claude build from spec alone? |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| Data model | Yes — DATA-STORAGE.md + INSTANCE-CONFIG.md |
| API layer | Yes — API-CONTRACTS.md (1303 lines, 5 endpoints) |
| Business logic | Yes — BOOKING-FLOW.md (11 decision tables) + EDGE-CASES.md (31 cases) |
| UI/UX | Yes — 6 Phase 7 docs + 40 Phase 5 screenshots |
| Real-time sync | Yes — POLLING-SYNC.md + STATE-MANAGEMENT.md |
| Build plan | Yes — SPEC.md 8 milestones with document references |

---

## Build Plan Coverage

All 8 milestones in SPEC.md reference correct primary and supporting documents.

| Milestone | Topic | Primary Docs | Status |
|-----------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Data Model | DATA-STORAGE.md, INSTANCE-CONFIG.md | Covered |
| 2 | API Endpoints | API-CONTRACTS.md | Covered |
| 3 | Booking Logic | BOOKING-FLOW.md, EDGE-CASES.md, TIME-DATE-HANDLING.md | Covered |
| 4 | UI Layout | LAYOUT-STRUCTURE.md, DESIGN-TOKENS.md, screenshots | Covered |
| 5 | Interactive States | COMPONENT-STATES.md, KEYBOARD-SHORTCUTS.md | Covered |
| 6 | Features | BOOK-NOW-FEATURE.md, TIMEZONE-TOGGLE.md | Covered |
| 7 | Real-Time Sync | POLLING-SYNC.md, STATE-MANAGEMENT.md, API-CONTRACTS.md | Covered |
| 8 | Responsive + Polish | RESPONSIVE-BEHAVIOR.md, ANIMATIONS.md, EDGE-CASES.md | Covered |

---

## Anti-Patterns

No blocking anti-patterns found across any phase.

**Info-level notes (non-blocking):**
- Phase 8 SUMMARY files reference React-specific terms (acceptable in SUMMARYs, main docs are technology-neutral)
- Phase 8 STATE-MANAGEMENT.md and POLLING-SYNC.md include "Technology Translation" sections comparing React vs Rails (helpful, not a problem)

---

## Tech Debt

No tech debt accumulated. All phases delivered complete deliverables with no deferred items, TODOs, or placeholder content.

---

## Document Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total deliverable documents | 21 |
| Total documentation lines | ~21,490 |
| Screenshots (raw + annotated) | 40 |
| Extracted code files | 39 |
| Decision tables | 11 |
| Edge cases cataloged | 31 |
| Phase verification reports | 6 (all PASSED) |
| Human verification | Completed (Phase 10) |

---

## Conclusion

Milestone v2.0 "Booking Spec Package" has achieved its definition of done:

1. **Visual capture** of every state/interaction from the deployed version
2. **Clean reference code** extracted from this repo (stripped of dead code)
3. **Blueprint-level specs**: UI, UX, architecture, functionality, edge cases
4. **Master SPEC.md** written as an AI-consumable prompt/instruction set

The specification package is complete, internally consistent, fully cross-referenced, and ready for consumption by a Rails Claude Code instance.
